# Easy Peasy Arabizi: Diacritizations and Transliteration FAQ

## How do I get an API key?

1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com and register for an account.
2. Under Settings > API Keys > Create new key

Anthropic rate limits its api usage, and you currently have to pay for access. In the future, we may switch to a subscription model where you pay us for credits and we handle the backend.

## Why the name?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabizi
Arabizi is a set of Arabic romanization systems that evolved for use on cell phones with limited RTL support. It's now a common method of transcribing Arabic. In Easy Peasy Arabizi, we made the default arabizi style match the one used in Duolingo,for the sake of Arabic students. The common transliterations for the Levantine dialect can also be used, as can standard MSA transliteration, and you can also set custom rules.
